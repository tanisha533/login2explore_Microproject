Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

## 📌 What’s this project about?

This is a mini project where I made a simple **student registration form** using HTML, JavaScript (jQuery), and **JsonPowerDB** (a fast and lightweight database that works well with JSON).

The form collects student info like:
- Roll Number
- Name
- Class
- Birth Date
- Address
- Enrollment Date

All data is saved in a special table (`STUDENT-TABLE-NEW`) inside the `SCHOOL2-DB` database.

## 💡 Why I used JsonPowerDB

- 🛠️ Schema-free (no fixed table structure needed)
- ⚡ Fast and light to use
- 🔐 Uses a secure token for access
- 🔁 Works like a document store or key-value store
- 📦 Easy to test with Talent API Tester
- 📄 Works directly with JSON data

## 🧑‍🏫 Where this can be used

- School admin can keep digital records
- Used for dashboards or ID card generation
- Can be extended for attendance or grade systems

## ✅ Project Status

- ⚠️ **Database setup completed successfully**
- ❌ **Form could not be fully tested due to Chrome security (CORS) restrictions**
- 💡 All backend logic and API integration steps are written and ready
- 🔁 Future improvements: Add delete and list features once testing is resolved
